# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

A dataset was gathered from a hypothetical LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company,who wants to use
machine learning to predict credit risk of their comany. They need help building and evaluating several ML models,
oversampling and undersampling the data, and evaluataing the performance of the models to determine how well they 
predict data. Management believes this will provide a more reliable loan experience, and lead to a more accurate
identification of good candidates for loans.

## Results

### Outputs form All Six Models
      
      . The naive random overampling algorithm resulted in a balanced accuracy score of 0.65. the precision score was
        1.0 for predicting low risk, but also extremely for predicting high risk 0.01. The recall score was 0.61 for high
        risk and 0.69 for low risk.
        
        
        
      . The SMOTE algorithm resulted in a balanced accuracy score of 0.64. The presision for for predicting the high and low
        risk was the same as the naive random oversampling algorithm. the recall scores were 0.71 for high and 0.57 for low risk
        respectively.
        
        
      . The Cluster Centroids algorithm resulted in as balanced accuracy score of 0.79. The precision for predicting high risk was 
        0.03 and 1.00 for low risk. The recall scores were 0.70 and 0.87 high and low risk, respectively.
